                <li>0.5 cup of fresh cilantro</li>
                <li>1 stick of butter (4oz.)</li>
                <li>1 tbsp garam masala</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Accoutrements:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups uncooked basmati rice</li>
                <li>2-4 naan flatbreads</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Add 2 cups of uncooked basmati rice and water to a rice cooker, and turn on. Once done, fluff lightly and keep warm until ready to serve.</li>
                <li>Peel and roughly chop onion. Crush and peel garlic cloves. Wash and cut ginger root into coins.</li>
                <li>Set Instant Pot to saute on high, and add oil. (If chicken thighs are frozen, skip this step, step 4, step 5, and step 6.)</li>
                <li>Once oil is heated, add chicken thighs and brown on both sides. Remove chicken and set aside.</li>
                <li>Add onion and ginger, cooking until browned and onion has become translucent.</li>
                <li>Add garlic and cook until fragrant (about 30-45 seconds).</li>
                <li>Turn off the saute function, add tomatoes and spices, and mix thoroughly. (Also add onion, ginger, and garlic if step 4-6 were skipped. Further, add cashews if desired).</li>
                <li>Return chicken and place lid on the Instant Pot, pressure cook on high for 15 minutes. (20 minutes if using frozen chicken thighs.)</li>
                <li>While chicken is cooking, wash and chop cilantro.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees, and place naan on a baking sheet.</li>
                <li>After the Instant Pot timer has gone off, allow to naturally release pressure.</li>
                <li>Remove chicken from pot and allow to cool slightly. Chop chicken into 2" cubes.</li>
                <li>Add second tbsp of garam masala to remaining liquid, and blend well with a hand blender.</li>
                <li>Add heavy whipping cream and cubed butter, stirring constantly until butter has completely melted. (Alternatively; the hand blender can be used, but beware blending cold cubes of butter as this can create a huge mess!) </li>
                <li>Lighly spray naan with cold water and bake in the oven for 3-4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Return chicken to gravy and add cilantro, reserving a small amount of cilantro for garnishing. Keep warm until ready to serve.</li>
                <li>Serve by placing rice and butter chicken in a bowl garnished on top with remaining cilantro, and a naan on the side.</li>
            </ol>
